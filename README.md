# DataAnalysisAI
This project was designed to get up-and-running quickly with statsmodels, and ready to use data analysis tools. I applied the analysis of Covid-19 distribution in San Francisco to perform this analysis.

Starting from cleaned dataset, we will show the steps needed to estimate a statistical model and to draw a diagnostic plot. We will use functions provided by statsmodels or its pandas and patsy dependencies, along with numpy and matplotlib to perform logistic regression and data visualization.
